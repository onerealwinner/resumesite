        I don't consider my career path in IT typical. I am not sure if it is
        how others present their cases or if it really is.

        When my dad heard about computers, he is taken back. He got very
        involved very quickly, although we didn't have much my dad met somebody
        who was willing to give him a loan for a 386 computer. He taught himself
        how to program in QBasic and would create puzzles for us to solve. We
        were in the minority of population of the town that had a computer in
        our house in the early 90s before mainstream internet.

        Particaullary, I wasn't very interested in computers. Me and my brother
        enjoyed playing games on it. It wasn't until middle school I started to
        get involved with computers. This cocendienditally was the time, my Dad
        and a business partner started a business in our small town. S&T
        Computer's was the name they choose, they wanted to offer businesses and
        the public software, hardware, networking, gaming (basically anything to
        do with computer at the time you could call us). I started in IT at a
        young age, when computers still weren't in everybodies homes (or
        pockets). The internet was just becoming mainstream and I was a freshman
        in high school in a small oilfield town.
