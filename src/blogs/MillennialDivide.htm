<h1>Navigating the Millennial Divide: A Tale of Two Generations</h1>

Recently I was listening to an audiobook by Clay Scroggins and it reminded me of a key difference between older millenials and younger millenials
, it went something like this, if you can remember trying to find a quarter at a gas station to make a phone call you had a vastly different experience growing up.
This was the time the internet was slowly growing into mainstream with dial-up connections and landline telephones.  
Very shortly after there was an explosion of technological growth that really put younger millenials in a different category.

Younger millenials haven't had that experience, by the time they were in high school they had cell phones in hand.  
Some younger millenials can't remember a time before wifi,  

Millennials, often referred to as "Gen Y," have been a hot topic for the better part of the last two decades. But the term “millennial” is a broad stroke, painting over a myriad of experiences, trends, and values. Today, we're here to examine the interesting generational divide that exists within the millennial cohort itself, namely between older and younger millennials.

The Changing Times:
Older millennials, born between 1981 and 1989, came of age in a very different world than their younger counterparts (born 1990-1996). 
They remember a time before the internet was ubiquitous, often reminiscing about dial-up connections and landline telephones. 
Conversely, younger millennials can scarcely remember a time before WiFi, smartphones, and the dominance of social media. 
This significant shift in technology during the formative years of both groups has dramatically impacted their attitudes
, experiences, and even their approach to technology itself.

The Economic Climate:
Another prominent distinction between the two subgroups of millennials is the economic climate they graduated into. 
Older millennials entered the job market during the Great Recession
, an experience that has indelibly marked their career trajectories and financial behaviors. 
On the other hand, younger millennials, who entered the workforce later, have experienced a comparatively healthier economy
, which has affected their job expectations and career paths.

Values and Priorities:
Although there is a considerable overlap in values
, including an emphasis on work-life balance and a desire for purposeful work
, there are noticeable differences too. Older millennials, having seen tougher economic times
, often display pragmatism in their career choices and financial decisions. 
In contrast, younger millennials, who came of age during a time of growing cultural and social liberalization
, tend to place a higher emphasis on social justice issues and championing diversity and inclusivity.

Social Media Landscapes:
Social media trends are another area where the millennial divide is apparent. 
Older millennials remember the days of MySpace and the dawn of Facebook, 
while younger millennials came of age during the rise of Instagram and Snapchat. 
This has influenced not only how each subgroup uses social media but also their attitudes towards privacy and online personas.

Conclusion:
The millennial divide is a fascinating look at how even within a single generation
, social, economic, and technological factors can shape and define experiences. 
It serves as a reminder of the vast heterogeneity that can exist within generational cohorts. 
As we continue to delve into understanding millennials, acknowledging this intra-generational divide allows 
for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of this much-discussed generation.
